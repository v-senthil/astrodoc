2. "connectionMessage" has the reason for the "canConnect" value,

### Phone number FAQs

[Why didn't I receive a one-time password (OTP) after using WhatsApp embedded signup?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup/faq#faq_848120369076858)

Businesses using phone numbers that are already registered to WhatsApp Messenger or the WhatsApp Business App can’t use these numbers for embedded signup. If their number is currently being used for the Business App then they need to delete it.

The instructions on how to delete the number and then request the number for WhatsApp embedded signup are located at [Migrate Phone Number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/phone-number#migrate).

[Which phone number and display name should a business sign up with?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup/faq#faq_691326491573701)

A business should sign up with the phone number and display\_name they want to use with the WhatsApp Business API. We strongly discourage signing up with a test or personal phone number or test display name as they will be difficult to change afterwards.

A business cannot sign up with a phone number that has already been registered for use with WhatsApp Messenger or the WhatsApp Business App.

[When can we download the certificate?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup/faq#faq_1296500774019000)

BSPs can download certificates as soon as a business has signed up. At this time, you should also start up the WhatsApp Business API client, so that the business can send messages while in an unverified state.

Certificates can be downloaded for phone numbers in trial experience and for phone numbers that have completed all reviews (Business Verification, WhatsApp checks, an display name review).  Only the BSPs can download certificates —businesses are not allowed to do this.
